# Competitive-CLI

It is a command line interface that lets a user interact with websites including but not limited to

- UVA Online Judge
- CodeChef
- Codeforces

Support for more websites might be added later

Also planning on making an api for UVA Debug to help users debug their problems

## Features

- View/Download problem statements right from the command line
- Credentials will be saved locally so there won't be any need to login again and again
- Solutions can be submitted directly from the command line
- Can debug using UVA Debug
- In UVA Online Judge, checking if your solution is correct, is slightly cumbersome. This tool solves that problem
- We also scrape some relevant stats from the websites that you may want to know
